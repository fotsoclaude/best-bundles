# This is the Django API of Best Bundles.

An app where a user who want to subscribe to a bundle, can directly get the appropriate(s) bundles which feet his needs according to his budget.
We have 3 needs: Call, Datas and Sms. He prioritize then by giving a level: 1 - 3, 3 being the most important raison he needs a bundle.

We compare between 2 operators and send him a list of the best bundles within each operator which response to his needs and maximize his budget.

The bundles' source is a default Excel file with 2 sheet, each with the datas of one operator.

The front-end source code is available here : https://github.com/Elohim237/BestPlans
